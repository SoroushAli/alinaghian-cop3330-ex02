import java.util.Scanner;

/*
Example Output

What is the input string? Homer
Homer has 5 characters.

Constraints

Be sure the output contains the original string.
Use a single output statement to construct the output.
Use a built-in function of the programming language to determine the length of the string.

Challenges

If the user enters nothing, state that the user must enter something into the program.
Implement this program using a graphical user interface and update the character counter every time a key is pressed.
If your language doesnâ€™t have a particularly friendly GUI library, try doing this exercise with HTML and JavaScript instead.
